## 11/2/2025 - Schematic,PCB and Gerber  

This is my first time doing anything like this, so it took me long, i wanted to do everything on my own without depending on any chatbot. After a lot of google searches and docs and forums i finally finished this basic project. Im hoping i get good funding so that i can build more projects like this![3d view](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzcwMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4ad2d347ea3bf3901def2024fe3d0cb492ddba03/3d%20view.png)
